# Governance

ΣΛ is intended to be a conservative, standards-adjacent specification.

## Stewardship

ΣΛ was initially authored by Forrest Parker (GitHub: Zstar0) and is stewarded conservatively to preserve safety, clarity, and backward compatibility.

## Change process

- All changes MUST be proposed via **SΛCP** documents in `proposals/`.
- See `spec/SL_Change_Control_Protocol.md` for the normative rules.

## Design posture

- Prefer clarifying constraints over increasing expressiveness.
- Prefer halting semantics over inference.
- Prefer backwards compatibility for all MINOR releases.
