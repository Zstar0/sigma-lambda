# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but ΣΛ is intentionally conservative.

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue describing the ambiguity or failure mode.
2. Submit an SΛCP proposal in `proposals/` using the template.
3. Keep changes minimal and purely constraint-oriented.

## What we accept
- Clarifications that remove ambiguity
- Additional normative procedures that reduce misinterpretation
- Examples that improve understanding without adding “magic”

## What we do not accept
- Redefinition of existing operators
- Convenience-driven features
- Implicit defaults or inference rules
