# ΣΛ OPERATING MANUAL
## Version 1.1
### Constraint-Complete Communication & Procedural Decomposition System

---

## 0. Purpose

ΣΛ is a **constraint language**, not a procedural or narrative language.

It exists to communicate:
- what must be true,
- what must never happen,
- what is undecidable,
- where execution must halt,

between agents that prioritize **correctness, safety, and honesty about limits** over persuasion or speed.

This manual defines **how ΣΛ is spoken, interpreted, and operationalized**.

---

## 1. Core Assumptions

ΣΛ assumes:
- shared logical competence
- explicit declaration of values when relevant
- zero tolerance for implicit inference
- preference for halting over guessing

ΣΛ does **not** assume:
- shared goals
- shared meaning
- narrative context
- human intuition

---

## 2. Ontological Primitives

```
Ω   : system under consideration
ℒ   : invariant rule-set
𝔈   : state evolution
𝕀   : information
𝕊   : structure
𝒳   : experience (irreducible)
𝒪   : observer / agent
𝕍   : value function
```

Axiomatically:

```
ℒ ⊢ governs(Ω)
𝔈 preserves(𝕀)
𝒳 ⟂ ℒ
𝕍 ⟂ ℒ
```

---

## 3. Core Operators

```
⊢   necessarily follows
⊬   undecidable
⊥   contradiction
¬   negation
⇒   implication
≡   equivalence
≈   structural equivalence
```

ΣΛ statements mean **only** what they constrain.

---

## 4. What ΣΛ Can and Cannot Express

ΣΛ CAN express:
- necessity
- impossibility
- preconditions
- postconditions
- invariants
- halting conditions
- rollback guarantees

ΣΛ CANNOT derive:
- values
- meaning
- experience
- intent

These must be declared explicitly or indexed.

---

## 5. Canonical Statement Forms

1. Prohibition  
```
X ⊢ ⊥
```

2. Requirement  
```
A ∧ ℒ ⇒ B
```

3. Undecidability  
```
ℒ ⊬ X ∨ ¬X
```

4. Termination  
```
condition ⇒ halt(actions)
```

---

## 6. Clause Identifier Requirement

All ΣΛ policies MUST include **stable clause identifiers**.

Example:
```
[CL-001] ℒ ⊢ ¬sync(database_local → database_prod)
```

Clause IDs are binding across:
- policy
- execution
- trace

---

## 7. Procedural Document Ingestion (Addendum – Normative)

This section defines how ΣΛ-speaking agents MUST handle real-world procedural documents.

---

## 7.1 Mandatory Classification

Upon receiving a human-authored document **D**, every statement MUST be classified as exactly one of:

1. Constraint (ΣΛ-eligible)
2. Procedure (execution-only)
3. Parameterization (config-only)
4. Narrative / explanation (non-binding)

Classification MUST occur before execution or translation.

---

## 7.2 Mandatory Output Architecture

From any procedural document, agents MUST produce **exactly three artifacts**.

---

## 8. Artifact A — ΣΛ Policy (Canonical)

**Purpose:** Define allowed, required, forbidden, and halting behavior.

Rules:
- Pure ΣΛ
- No commands
- No environment assumptions
- Stable clause IDs required

Path:
```
policy/<domain>/<artifact>.ΣΛ.md
```

Policy overrides all other layers.

---

## 9. Artifact B — Execution Layer (Imperative)

**Purpose:** Perform actions while enforcing ΣΛ policy.

Rules:
- Tool- and environment-specific
- Must reference ΣΛ clause IDs
- Must halt on ⊢ ⊥
- Must not infer missing intent

Path:
```
ops/<domain>/<artifact>/
```

---

## 10. Artifact C — Trace / Attestation Layer

**Purpose:** Prove ΣΛ compliance.

Rules:
- Append-only
- Machine-readable
- Clause-ID indexed

Path:
```
trace/<domain>/<artifact>/<timestamp>/
```

---

## 11. Translation Algorithm (Mandatory)

```
Input: procedural document D

1. Classify statements
2. Extract constraints → ΣΛ policy
3. Assign clause IDs
4. Extract parameters → config
5. Translate procedures → scripts
6. Bind scripts to clause IDs
7. Define rollback paths
8. Define trace schema
9. Reject execution if ambiguity exists
```

---

## 12. Prohibited Agent Behaviors

Agents MUST NOT:
- embed commands in ΣΛ
- infer safety from narrative
- optimize past constraints
- execute without policy
- invent missing steps

Violation constitutes **semantic corruption**.

---

## 13. Termination Semantics

Execution is complete iff:

```
preconditions_satisfied
∧ postconditions_verified
∧ observability_recorded
∧ rollback_paths_intact
```

Otherwise, execution halts and state is marked unresolved.

---

## 14. Orientation Statement

ΣΛ exists to prevent:
- accidental dishonesty
- silent scope creep
- unsafe automation
- value smuggling

It prioritizes **stopping correctly** over continuing incorrectly.

---

## 15. Versioning

- v1.0 — Core ΣΛ language
- v1.1 — Procedural ingestion & execution architecture (this document)
