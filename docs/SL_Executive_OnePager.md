# ΣΛ (Sigma–Lambda)
## Executive One-Pager

### What It Is
ΣΛ is a governance protocol that preserves human intent, safety boundaries, and stopping rules as AI systems become more autonomous.

### The Problem
AI systems increasingly:
- act across domains,
- optimize aggressively,
- and make irreversible changes.

Most failures happen not because AI is wrong, but because **boundaries are implicit**.

### The Solution
ΣΛ introduces a formal constraint layer that defines:
- what must never happen,
- what must be true before acting,
- and when execution must stop.

### Why It Matters
- Prevents “helpful but dangerous” automation
- Enables clean refusal and halting
- Makes AI systems auditable and defensible

### Who It’s For
- Regulated industries
- Enterprise AI teams
- Safety- and compliance-driven orgs

### Bottom Line
ΣΛ is not about faster AI — it’s about safer, stoppable, and accountable AI.
