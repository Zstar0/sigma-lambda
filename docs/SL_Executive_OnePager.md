# ΣΛ (Sigma–Lambda)

## Executive One-Pager

### What It Is

ΣΛ is a governance protocol that preserves human intent, safety boundaries, and stopping rules as AI systems become more autonomous.

It works as a **guardrail layer for autonomous AI agents** — agents prove compliance or halt.

### The Problem

AI systems increasingly:

- act across domains,
- optimize aggressively,
- and make irreversible changes.

Most failures happen not because AI is wrong, but because **boundaries are implicit**.

As autonomous agents (coding assistants, agentic workflows, multi-step automation) become widely available, the risk compounds.

### The Solution

ΣΛ introduces a formal constraint layer that defines:

- what must never happen,
- what must be true before acting,
- and when execution must stop.

Agents do not "decide" whether to proceed — they **prove compliance or halt**.

### Why It Matters

- Prevents "helpful but dangerous" automation
- Enables clean refusal and halting
- Makes AI systems auditable and defensible
- Stops scope expansion and silent reinterpretation

### Who It's For

- Teams deploying autonomous AI agents (coding assistants, agentic workflows)
- Regulated industries (biotech, fintech, health)
- Enterprise AI teams
- Safety- and compliance-driven orgs

### Bottom Line

ΣΛ is not about faster AI — it's about **safer, stoppable, and accountable AI**.
